The code uses strncpy with an |n| (size) argument guaranteed to be too small so that strncpy never '\\0'-terminates the |s1| (destination) buffer. It then uses strlen to compute the length of the string that it just copied, despite the fact that it already knows how much data was just copied (it\u2019s exactly |n| bytes), and because there\u2019s no guarantee that there\u2019s a '\\0' after the strncpyed string, strlen might return too large a length. Notably, malloc doesn\u2019t zero memory it returns. Sometimes this code gets lucky and there\u2019s a '\\0' after the strncpyed string. Other times, there isn\u2019t, so strlen returns too large a result, and the subsequent memcpy is asked to write to memory beyond the end of the malloced buffer. Whatever\u2019s beyond the end of the buffer may not belong to anyone or it may belong to something else, but it sure won\u2019t belong to this code. That\u2019s why we saw \u201cincorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed\u201d (when the memory didn\u2019t belong to anyone and malloc found it had been tampered with on a subsequent allocation attempt) as well as random crashes throughout the code (when the memory did belong to someone else and it got trashed).\r\n\r\nI am currently working around this bug in my application by providing my own public symbol for __CTFontManagerUnregisterFontForData corresponding to an |extern \"C\"| function named _CTFontManagerUnregisterFontForData that\u2019s a no-op. Since SendDeactivateFontsInContainerMessage looks the symbol up with dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT), it finds my copy. Since ATS is apparently never successfully calling CTFontManagerUnregisterFontForData now because it looks the symbol up by an incorrect name, the no-op stub works around the bug without altering functionality.\r\n\r\nThe correct solution here is anything that prevents ATS from writing to memory that it doesn\u2019t own. Since SendDeactivateFontsInContainerMessage was apparently unsuccessful at calling CTFontManagerUnregisterFontForData all along, you may not want to \u201cfix\u201d the symbol name, because it might result in behavior changes. On the other hand, you will certainly want to fix the poor string handling in this function.", "classification": "Crash/Hang/Data Loss", "title": "Memory corruption in ATSFontDeactivate", "originated": "2011-08-18", "product_version": "10.7.1 11B26", "number": "9976774", "user": "mark@chromium.org", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1310402}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Safari", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nWith: Safari 5.1 on Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and Java plugin 1.6.0_26\r\n\r\nWhen Java Applet Connect with java.net.URLConnection Class on a Authenticated URL with Basic Authentication. \r\n\r\nJava Applet build the HTTP header \"Authorization Basic base64string\" wrongly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0.

This was true regardless of the trust policy supplied to SecTrustEvaluate.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 10.6.8/10.7.0, this has changed, in that if an SSL policy is located, SecTrustEvaluate() forces network fetches to be enabled. This regression means there is no API-supported way to disable revocation checking.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a policy with CSSMOID_APPLE_TP_SSL/SecPolicyCreateSSL.\r\n2) Pass the new SecPolicyRef into SecTrustCreateWithCertificates, specifying a certificate with an AIA extension. For example, the certificate for https://encrypted.google.com\r\n3) Call SecTrustSetParameters, making sure to explicitly NOT specify CSSM_TP_ACTION_FETCH_CERT_FROM_NET in the CSSM_APPLE_TP_ACTION_DATA.ActionFlags\r\n4) Call SecTrustEvaluate()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no attempt to retrieve http://www.gstatic.com/GoogleInternetAuthority/GoogleInternetAuthority.crt, which is the caIssuer found in the authorityInfoAccess. Because the \"Google Internet Authority\" intermediate certificate is not included in the Keychain/system roots, the certificate should fail to validate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe certificate validates fine, as the intermediate is fetched via AIA, and it chains to a trusted root, the \"Equifax Secure Certificate Authority\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis regressed in 10.6.8/10.7.0.

Really it just does a glorified copy of a stationery file into a location of the user's choosing - but it presents the user with a simplified interface for doing this.\r\n\r\nThe problem with sandboxing comes with how the utility chooses *where* to create the new file.\r\n\r\nInitially Neu was written to be triggered by a Services menu selected from the Finder. It would then create the new file in the location represented by the Finder window that the user had open when they opened the services menu.\r\n\r\nI am concerned that this may not work under sandboxing - unless the sandbox system automatically adds any paths that it supplies to an application to the list of allowed accesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a more serious problem. The Finder/Services integration isn't brilliant, and in particular, there's no way to right-click on a Finder window and have it show a services menu for the folder that the window represents (see rdar:7719410).\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I've added some other mechanisms for triggering Neu. These mechanisms rely on looking at the front window of the Finder, and inferring the location that the user wants to create files in from it. \r\n\r\nI'm assuming that this isn't going to work with sandboxing. Instead I'm going to have to throw up a \"Save As\" dialog and ask the user where to save the new file. This is already an option in Neu, but requiring it is going to annoy the users that turn it off by default.\r\n\r\nIt seems like sandboxing is a great idea, but if we're not careful it is going to destroy a whole class of utilities which work by integrating with other applications.

Both of these are running on an Ubuntu Linux 10.04 server. I was trying out setting up Lion as a client with these and found that alarmingly, the client seems to allow any network user to log on/authenticate with an incorrect password.\r\n\r\nWe had been using the same setup for a while with Snow Leopard, and found that by extending the OpenLDAP server schema with the apple.schema file from Open Directory, and adding the apple-user objectClass to our user records, we could add the required authAuthority attributes to the user records to tell OS X clients to authenticate the user via Kerberos. The only authAuthority attributes that we've added are the ;Kerberosv5; ones - there is no Apple Password Server involved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with an existing MIT Kerberos KDC, serving one realm \"REALM.ORG\" and an existing OpenLDAP server using the RFC2307 schema for users and groups (running on linux)\r\n2. Extend its schema with the Apple schema, including the apple-user object class and the authAuthority attribute.\r\n3. Create a user entry 'testuser' on the OpenLDAP server, with the apple-user objectClass, and create a principal for that user, 'testuser@REALM.ORG' on the KDC.\r\n4. Add the required authAuthority attribute to testuser's entry on the OpenLDAP server, with a value of \";Kerberosv5;;testuser@REALM.ORG;REALM.ORG\". Make sure the user entry for testuser on the OpenLDAP server has *no* userPassword attribute, the user's password should only be known by the KDC.\r\n5. Add the OpenLDAP server as a Directory server to a client machine running OS X 10.7, using Directory Utility.

I realize this is possible with 5.0 SDK beta 2 with the instruments command line, however this isn't very useful.  One needs to save a different template per config, per script needing to be run which means explosion of templates.  It is also very hard to version control said templates and have them run on systems where the templates weren't defined.\r\n\r\nFor this, we would need a command-line utility just for UIAutomation.

One should not have to jump through this kind of weird hoop :)\r\n\r\nHaving my unit tests right beside the class implementation is a great reminder to test, and having the unit tests in the primary editor while the class itself is in the assistant editor is a great way to do test-driven development.", "classification": "Enhancement", "title": "Treat unit test files as counterparts of class files", "originated": "09-Jul-2011 08:33 AM", "product_version": "Xcode 4", "number": "9748916", "user": "rix.rob@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1229422}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "When editing NIB files, there's no way to reveal them in the project navigator.\r\nI mainly use Quick Open to open files.

Imagine an app that allowed students to submit assignments online to their professors. We'll call it \"Submit-It.app\". Assume the student creates some digital artwork in some third-party editing app. Currently, Submit-It.app has no way to get at the artwork. As a result, it has to register as a viewer for all sorts of file types, then hope that the editing app uses a UIDocumentInteractionController. Then it has to instruct the user to go to the other app, find the UIDocumentInteractionController button, and share it with Submit-It.\r\n\r\nNot a great user experience, to say the least. It would be much better if Submit-It could get a list of documents being shared by other apps, and open a copy of any shared document.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there's already a mechanism for allowing document sharing: the UIFileSharingEnabled key in an app's Info.plist allows an app's documents to be shared... with iTunes. This has always been a weird model of interaction, since users generally don't expect to drag arbitrary documents into iTunes. In the \"cut the cord\" world of iOS 5, it makes even less sense. \r\n\r\nI'd like to request a new view controller, similar to UIImagePickerController. Rather than showing photos in albums, though, it would show shared documents in other apps. Selecting a document in another app would allow the current app access to that document. Some use cases, such as the Submit-It app, would only require read-only access to the documents. Some apps might want to allow write access to their documents folders in the same way that the existing file sharing mechanism allows iTunes to modify an app's documents.\r\n\r\nThis single new controller object would open up a much more natural mechanism of collaboration between applications, without exposing the underlying file system. It's opt-in, so it doesn't break existing sandboxing. It doesn't allow arbitrary access; the user has to explicitly select a document. Basically, it maintains all the user control while at the same time enabling some cool stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Update --\r\n\r\nOf course, there could be problems if an app attempted to open a file of some proprietary format that it didn't know how to handle. Core Data SQLite stores, for example, are essentially unusable unless the receiving app has access to the schema. But maybe the receiving app comes from the same company, and DOES have access to it. So you don't want to limit shared documents to just a few document types.\r\n\r\nRequiring the receiving app to handle arbitrary file types could be problematic, as it requires all developers to implement graceful failure on unknown types. That's not likely to happen.\r\n\r\nBut there's already a built-in solution to this problem in iOS. UIDocumentInteractionController allows a user to open files in other apps, but only if those apps have declared themselves as viewers for that UTI. This new controller could use the same mechanism -- it would only show a shared document if the receiving app was registered as a viewer for that UTI. An app that knew how to handle only pdfs would only see pdfs. An app that knew how to handle certain data stores would have access to those. An app that just wanted to upload raw data to a web service could register as a viewer of public.data, and have access to all files.", "classification": "Feature (New)", "title": "Allow applications access to documents shared by other applications", "originated": "6/24/2011", "product_version": "4.3", "number": "9672947", "user": "bjhomer@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Not Applicable", "id": 1222407}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "iOS", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nUINavigationBar loses transparency when another view is presented modally on top of it.

It works properly on a real iOS device and in desktop Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild and run this program. You can do this for the iOS Simulator, an iOS device, and desktop Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n--\r\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n#include <time.h>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\r\n  NSLog(@\"Before: %d\", timezone);\r\n  tzset();\r\n  NSLog(@\"After: %d\", timezone);\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n--\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe expected \u201cafter\u201d value is 18000 in New York and 28800 in Cupertino. The value should be the number of seconds west of UTC during standard (not daylight) time for the currently selected time zone. This is 5 * 60 * 60 in New York and 8 * 60 * 60 in Cupertino.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe iOS device (4.3) and desktop OS (10.6.7) both report the proper \u201cafter\u201d value. For me, this is 18000, because my system is configured to use New York as the time zone.\r\n\r\nThe iOS simulator (4.3) shows both 1474660693 for the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d values.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone that I can see, although it is an unnecessary area of divergence between the iOS device and simulator targets.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis bug is caused by the simulator\u2019s libSystem (libc) design, which overlays \u2026.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib on top of the host system\u2019s /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib. Other similar bugs may be present, the one I\u2019m reporting relates to the use of the \u201ctimezone\u201d variable.\r\n\r\nIn the iOS (and iOS Simulator) SDK\u2019s <sys/cdefs.h>, there is no non-UNIX2003 mode for source code at all. iOS is always UNIX2003. This is controlled by the __DARWIN_ONLY_UNIX_CONFORMANCE macro. Thus, according to <time.h>, there should only be a timezone variable, and no timezone(int, int) function, because __DARWIN_UNIX03 is always be defined for iOS and the iOS Simulator. At the binary level, libSystem (libc) only offers timezone in the data section in the iOS device SDK; this is the timezone variable. There is no timezone(int, int) function. However, the design of libSystem (libc) for the iOS simulator target presents a timezone symbol in the text section.\r\n\r\nmark@selecty bash$ nm /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.3.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib | grep timezone\r\n0000d298 T _timezone\r\n\r\nT for Text. There isn\u2019t any corresponding declaration for this timezone function, but it\u2019s present in the Simulator\u2019s \u2026.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib. This libSystem.dylib itself relies on \u2026.sdk/usr/lib/system/libSystem.host.dylib, which is a symbolic link to the real native /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib. That means that compiled code is expecting to see a timezone variable according to this declaration:\r\n\r\nextern long timezone;\r\n\r\nbut ld actually resolves \u201ctimezone\u201d as the text symbol, which is a timezone function. There\u2019s no error or warning because the linker had no idea that the source expected \u201ctimezone\u201d in a specific section, it simply resolves symbols by name, and it finds the one in the text section first because that\u2019s what\u2019s present in \u2026.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib.\r\n\r\nThe value of timezone in the simulator is always 1474660693 (when you expect 18000). This isn\u2019t a function pointer, it\u2019s the first few instructions of the timezone function.\r\n\r\nThis all became clear to me when I printed 1474660693 in hexadecimal. It\u2019s 0x57e58955. That looks very much like an x86 function prologue.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging this, I found dladdr to be handy. Noting that the value of \u201cdaylight\u201d was correct while the value of \u201ctimezone\u201d was not, I wrote:\r\n\r\nDl_info dli;\r\nint dlr = dladdr(&timezone, &dli);\r\nNSLog(@\"timezone dlr=%d fname=%s fbase=%p sname=%s saddr=%p\", dlr, dli.dli_fname, dli.dli_fbase, dli.dli_sname, dli.dli_saddr);\r\n\r\ndlr = dladdr(&daylight, &dli);\r\nNSLog(@\"daylight dlr=%d fname=%s fbase=%p sname=%s saddr=%p\", dlr, dli.dli_fname, dli.dli_fbase, dli.dli_sname, dli.dli_saddr);\r\n\r\nand noted the difference in output:\r\n\r\ntimezone dlr=1 fname=/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.3.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib\r\nfbase=0xcae000 sname=timezone saddr=0xcbb298\r\ndaylight dlr=1 fname=/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib fbase=0x90a5b000\r\nsname=daylight saddr=0xa00a67b4\r\n\r\nNote the difference between the fname for each. timezone is coming from \u2026.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib as opposed to the host\u2019s /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib, but \u2026.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib exposes timezone as a text symbol, not data.\r\n\r\nAnd finally:\r\n\r\nmark@selecty bash$ gdb -q\r\n(gdb) file /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.3.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib\r\n[...]\r\n(gdb) disas timezone timezone+4\r\nDump of assembler code from 0xd298 to 0xd29c:\r\n0x0000d298 <timezone+0>:        push   %ebp\r\n0x0000d299 <timezone+1>:        mov    %esp,%ebp\r\n0x0000d29b <timezone+3>:        push   %edi\r\nEnd of assembler dump.\r\n(gdb) x/1 timezone\r\n0xd298 <timezone>:      0x57e58955\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s the phantom value.", "classification": "Other Bug", "title": "Can\u2019t use \u201ctimezone\u201d variable (libc) in iOS Simulator", "originated": "06/13/2011", "product_version": "4.3", "number": "9599977", "user": "mark@chromium.org", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1216404}, {"status": "", "resolved": "", "product": "", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsers currently have to click on a support link within a product's iTunes page, which may or may not go anywhere useful.

The delay is always present, but its length increases when precise timing is requested, and also when the server provides the file slowly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached which reproduces the problem.  It was created as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Schedule an NSTimer instance on the main run loop at an interval of 0.1 seconds.\r\n\r\n2. Use AVFoundation classes to load and play remote media as described here:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AVFoundationPG/Articles/02_Playback.html\r\n\r\n3.

Monitor the interval between timer firings, reporting it if it is more than 50% longer than the requested interval.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe timer will continue to fire within a reasonable margin of the requested interval, possibly reporting an unknown duration.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn the best case, where the server provides the media quickly or precise timing is not requested, the timer will be delayed once for about 1 second, which might be noticeable to the user but not egregious.\r\n\r\nIf precise timing is requested, the timer will be delayed once for around 20 seconds for a 12 minute MP3, and generally this delay seems proportional to the file's size.\r\n\r\nIf the precise timing is requested and the server provides the media slowly (this is not included in the attached example), the timer will be delayed for a period that varies with the length of the server's speed.  To demonstrate this, I set up my server to sleep for a varying amount of time after transmitting each 8k block or part thereof.  With precise timing requested, and loading a 90 second clip, the results are as follows:\r\n\r\nper-block server delay (in seconds) => client delay (in seconds)\r\n0.1 =>  7\r\n0.2 => 12\r\n0.3 => 18\r\n0.4 => 24\r\n0.5 => The asset fails to load.\r\n\r\nWithout precise timing requested, the delay is more constant:\r\n0.1 => 0.9\r\n0.2 => 0.7\r\n0.3 => 0.7\r\n0.4 => 0.6\r\n0.5 => 0.8\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis can cause trouble for audio players that update their interfaces using an NSTimer.

To confirm something with an \"OK\" is very colloquial and so it does not match the level of formality in Mac OS X interface. \"Budi\u017e\" is a Czech word that can be used for confirmation in any context in which Mac OS X uses \"OK\".\r\n\r\nFrequency and context of usage of the words \"OK\" (pronounced \"oukej\", \"ou kej\", or \"\u00f3 k\u00e1\" in Czech) and \"budi\u017e\" in a current Czech spoken corpus from primary and secondary school lessons[1] reveals that:\r\n\r\n- OK is used only three times: in two classes, in both cases to explain which button to use in a software where \"OK\" wasn't translated:\r\n\r\nhttp://box.nohejl.name/lev/budiz-diskuse/schola2010-OK.png\r\n\r\n(Translation: \"set up. be careful not to press 'oukej', because that would take you back again\", \"set up and confirm. now confirm using 'oukej', close, close the whole dialog.\", \"so here you will have a table. then use 'oukej'. And then you will have the field here from which you can\".)\r\n\r\n- Budi\u017e is used four times in four different classes, in one case in a citation of a literary work, but otherwise it occurs in the sentence naturally to confirm\u00a0or approve something:\r\n\r\nhttp://box.nohejl.name/lev/budiz-diskuse/schola2010-budiz.png\r\n\r\n(Translation: \"inner life of the main character, alright, 'budi\u017e'. I'm listening to you. ...\", then the literary quotation, \"that's not a daily but a weekly newspaper, 'budi\u017e' nonetheless. What else? ...\", \"movement. blender? blender. blender, alright, 'budi\u017e' blender. washmashine. washmashine, alright, washmashine\")\r\n\r\nBudi\u017e should be comprehensible to anyone, and can be used in formal and informal context. (I have chosen the spoken corpus from schools, which I believe provides the right level of formality, to prove the point. In newspapers, \"budi\u017e\" would be even more common, and \"OK\" virtually absent except for quotations of slang and computer interface elements.) \r\n\r\nAnother argument is that \"Budi\u017e\" has been used in Czech Mac OS localizations up until now and long-time Mac users are used to it. The only possible argument against \"Budi\u017e\" is that other software than Mac OS (X) and devices commonly use \"OK\", so people are used to seeing \"OK\" in the computer context often even if the rest of the interface is translated to Czech. But even for these people Budi\u017e should not be confusing, it is a clear, unambigous, and relatively common (see corpus citations above) word.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] Czech National Corpus/\u010cesk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed korpus - SCHOLA2010. \u00dastav \u010cesk\u00e9ho n\u00e1rodn\u00edho korpusu FF UK, Praha 2010.

As I have said a natural way to say this is \"Nen\u00ed ozna\u010den\u00e1 (vybran\u00e1) \u017e\u00e1dn\u00e1 schr\u00e1nka\".\r\n\r\n2. The verb \"vybrat\" in conjunction with the terse formulation suggests this meaning \"(the contents of) the mailbox have not been taken out\", which would likely mean that no messages were downloaded. In normal speech \"vybrat schr\u00e1nku\" means to get mail out of a mailbox.\r\n\r\nThis is connected with radar #9441516, in which I explain why \"select\" should be translated as \"ozna\u010dit\", not as \"vybrat\". If you use \"ozna\u010dit\" in this case, the terse formulation (schr\u00e1nka neozna\u010dena) at least won't be ambiguous (but it will still be very awkward).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest (1) using a longer formulation for the window title and (2) reevaluating the translation of \"select\" in Mac OS X.

The most choice would probably be to name the application \"Kontakty\" (\"Contacts\").

The former, although not used except for computer slang, may be a matter of taste, the latter (\"poklik\u00e1n\u00ed\") sounds ridiculous. Possible alternatives are \"klepnout, klepnut\u00ed, poklep\u00e1n\u00ed\" or \"kliknout, kliknut\u00ed, dvojit\u00e9 kliknut\u00ed\".\r\n\r\nDiscussion: The word \"kliknout\" and derived words is often used in Czech for English \"click\" in the computer context, it's a widely used slang and comprehensible to anyone with some experience with computers. The corresponding slang for \"double-click\" is \"dvojklik / dvojit\u00e9 kliknut\u00ed\" (noun), \"kliknout dvakr\u00e1t\" (verb). Poklik\u00e1n\u00ed sounds very weird. Former Czech Mac OS localizations since System 6 have used the words \"klepnout\" and \"poklepat\" (tap, tap two or more times, respectively). This was a very natural choice that avoided slang (anything with \"klik\"), awkward or non-existing words with funny associations (\"poklik\u00e1n\u00ed\" associates \"popuk\u00e1n\u00ed\", \"pokak\u00e1n\u00ed\", \"poblink\u00e1n\u00ed\", informal words for laughter, excrements and vomit), and I believe that it was universally comprehensible. \"Kliknut\u00ed\", while informal, will be comprehensible to people that already have experience with computers and know the English word \"click\". So choice between the two may be a matter of taste, but if for some reason you want to change \"poklepat\" to \"kliknout\", it would be better to use \"kliknout dvakr\u00e1t\", \"dvojit\u00e9 kliknut\u00ed\" and certainly not \"poklik\u00e1n\u00ed\".", "classification": "UI/Usability", "title": "Translation of \"click\" in the Czech localization", "originated": "15-May-2011 02:39 PM", "product_version": "10.7 DP", "number": "9441556", "user": "adamnhjl@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1194406}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Mac OS X", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe word \"Select\" and derived words (as in \"Select All\", \"Selected\", \"Selection\") is translated as \"Vybrat\" (\"Vybrat v\u0161e\", \"Vybran\u00e9\", \"V\u00fdb\u011br\") instead of \"Ozna\u010dit\" (\"Ozna\u010dit v\u0161e\", \"Ozna\u010den\u00e9\", \"Ozna\u010den\u00e9\"), which is a better alternative in most context and has been used in Czech Mac OS localization in the past (probably since System 6.0).\r\n\r\nDiscussion:\r\n\r\n\"Vybrat\" means to pick one or a small number of elements, it would be used is used as a natural translation of \"Choose\" or \"Pick\" in most context. It can be used to mean \"to select an arbitrary area\" (as opposed to one of a few predefined areas). \"Vybrat v\u0161e\" as a translation for \"Select All\" also sounds very unnatural (similar to \"Choose all\" in English) and suggest the other common meaning of the word \"vybrat\": to withdraw or scoop out.\r\n\r\n\"Ozna\u010dit\" covers all the meanings in which Select is used in Mac software and can be more naturally used in the context \"Select an area\" (\"Ozna\u010dit oblast\"), \"Select all\", (\"Ozna\u010dit v\u0161e\"). The only possible drawback is that \"Ozna\u010dit\" can be used to mean \"to mark\". This should not be an issue, as various more specific translation of the word \"Mark\" can be used when needed. (Mail already uses \"Vlo\u017eit zna\u010dku\". Alternatives include \"Vlo\u017eit/P\u0159idat zna\u010dku/ozna\u010den\u00ed\".

As summarized by the Wikipedia page for FaceTime <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime>: \r\n\r\n\"Upon the launch of the iPhone 4, Jobs promised that Apple would work in due course with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an \"open standard.\" As of April 2011, it is not yet known to have been ratified by any standards body, and the extent of work by Apple with regards to this promise is unclear as Apple has not released technical specifications for the service. FaceTime is not currently supported on any non-Apple devices.[citation needed]\r\nWhile FaceTime is based on open standards, Apple's FaceTime service requires a client-side certificate[7].

Device is locked.\r\n\r\nWhen your application is in the foreground (with cover closed) and you receive a local notification, the notification is launched properly (you hear the notification).  When you open the cover, the notification will be displayed with your application in the background.  If you press the action button on your notification, no UIApplicationDelegate callback is invoked.  You do NOT receive any notice of a button being pressed (as you do not differentiate between the Close button and the Action button).  As a result, if your application attempts to react to the action button, it's impossible.\r\n\r\nFor example: VoIP application trying to accept a phone call.  When receiving a phone call, the user opens the smart cover and sees the notification.  The user presses 'Answer' but the application receives no notification of Close/Answer and is forced to display another dialog of sorts to prompt the user to accept the call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1- Lock application using Smart Cover\r\n2- Receive a Local Notification\r\n3- Unlock application using Smart Cover\r\n4- You will see a notification (Expected)\r\n5- You press answer - No callbacks are called (Unexpected)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome callback on the UIApplicationDelegate that will tell us whether or not a local notification has been accepted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo callback, application must display a second prompt -- this is poor user experience.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown, but most likely not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation: \"When the system delivers a local notification, several things can happen, depending on the application state and the type of notification.

If the notification is an alert and the user taps the action button (or, if the device is locked, drags open the action slider), the application is launched. In the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method the application delegate can obtain the UILocalNotification object from the passed-in options dictionary by using the UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey key. The delegate can inspect the properties of the notification and, if the notification includes custom data in its userInfo dictionary, it can access that data and process it accordingly. On the other hand, if the local notification only badges the application icon, and the user in response launches the application, the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method is invoked, but no UILocalNotification object is included in the options dictionary.\r\n\r\nIf the application is foremost and visible when the system delivers the notification, no alert is shown, no icon is badged, and no sound is played.

Since iTunes 10.2.2 shipped, we've noticed servers dropping offline periodically.  We've correlated this to iTunes clients refreshing podcast feeds.  It seems that iTunes is hitting every item in the feed, multiple times, simultaneously.  I've occasionally been able to get iTunes to do this by subscribing to a podcast, quitting, and then relaunching iTunes.  All of the \"Bad\" traffic has an AppleCoreMedia user agent, while all of the \"Good\" traffic (the connections actually performing the downloads seen in the iTunes UI) have an iTunes user agent.\r\n\r\nI've attached an excerpt of an apache log showing the type of traffic being generated by a single student launching iTunes.  Since all of these loads involve a database call and pull files off Xsan, you can imagine how a few students doing this can essentially trash a server - it causes the 10.5.8 network stack to hang for 5+ minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDifficult to reproduce consistently.  As mentioned above, I've had the best luck subscribing to a feed, then quitting mid-download, then relaunching iTunes.

Unfortunately we discovered an issue with your binary that you will need to correct in order for your application to proceed to the review stage. The specific issue is outlined below:\r\n\r\nInvalid Signature - Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level (which override any values at the project level). Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target.

In particular, there is no way to interact with multiple applications at once without entirely switching to another application. Often, users do not want to interact with the entirety of an app if they plan to \"peek\" at it or use it alongside another; iOS forces them to. Other platforms solve this problem in several ways, such as allowing apps to have \"widgets\" that live in a common launcher space. This does not mesh well with the app-centric model of iOS, however. This enhancement request proposes a way that, in the poster's opinion, _does_ mesh well.\r\n\r\niOS apps currently have a single mode of use, in which an app uses the entire screen. This proposal adds another 'transient' mode of use, where an application can show a portion of itself temporarily onscreen, possibly partially overlaying another application. The portion is provided by the app as a view controller; the view controller is displayed onscreen in a popover pointing to the application's multitasking tile, or in a similar way that ties it explicitly to the app.\r\n\r\nThe above could be implemented as follows:\r\n\r\n \u2022 Apps supporting transient usage mode declare themselves in their Info.plist files with an appropriate key.\r\n\r\n \u2022 At any time, an event occurs that would cause the switch to the application. For legacy applications, this causes a normal app switch. For transient apps, the OS:\r\n  - launches the app in the background; and\r\n  - optionally, asks the application delegate how to handle the incoming interaction, for instance:\r\n\r\n- (UIApplicationModes) modesForApplication:(UIApplication*) app openingURL:(NSURL*) url sourceApplication:(NSString*) app annotation:(id) ann;\r\n{\r\n\t// for example, this application wants to perform a fullscreen switch only if\r\n\t// files are opened.\r\n\t\r\n\tif ([url isFileURL])\r\n\t\treturn UIApplicationModeSwitch; // can only switch\r\n\telse\r\n\t\treturn UIApplicationModeSwitch | UIApplicationModeTransient; // can show a transient view\t\t\r\n}\r\n\r\n  \u2022 If the app supports a transient view, the OS requests a view controller for display from the app delegate:\r\n\r\n- (UIViewController*) transientViewControllerForApplication:(UIApplication*) app;\r\n{\r\n\treturn [[[SomeViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@\"SomeViewController\" bundle:nil] autorelease];\r\n}\r\n\r\n  \u2022 The OS then displays the view appropriately. For example:\r\n   - on iPad, the multitasking tray opens, then a popover appears pointing to the application's tile on the tray. The popover contains the view controller. Touching outside the popover causes it to be dismissed, hiding the view. This is similar to the behavior of the Print Center tile provided by AirPrint.\r\n   - on iPhone, the multitasking tray opens to a higher height than normal. The view may appear in the extra space so shown. An arrow (similar to the one used for folders in Springboard) may point to the application tile in the tray. Dismissing the multitasking tray also dismisses this view.\r\n\r\nAs long as the view is displayed, the transient app is running; as far as the clients of the UIApplication singleton in it can tell, it is in the foreground and inactive. The app pushed up by the multitasking tray is also running, in the foreground and inactive. Dismissing the view causes the transient app to move to the background. The view could also have a \"full screen\" button (for example, in the popover's navigation bar). If tapped, the button would cause a transition to occur, which would end with a switch to the transient app (now taking the entire screen); just like any normal app switch, this would cause the previous application to move to the background.\r\n\r\nTo maintain a consistent experience, apps may be forbidden from invoking their transient view directly. The appaerance could be tied to events that would normally cause a fullscreen app switch. For example:\r\n - opening a URL;\r\n - opening a file;\r\n - the user tapping an alert button on a local or remote notification.\r\nThe user might also be able to invoke the transient view himself, for instance through a control included near the app's tile in the multitasking tray, or by touching a transient-capable app in the tray (which would cause the transient view to appear instead of switching to the entire app; a second touch would switch to the app). The app could also let the user access a transient view by posting a local notification.\r\n\r\nThe following are a set of use cases where this capability would be useful:\r\n\r\n - A file transfer application might accept files in the background. When a file arrives, the application could post a local notification. Opening it, only a quick \"tray\" containing the newly received files appears as a transient view. The user can quickly delete or open files, or return to their previous task.\r\n\r\n - A multiplayer game could have a long-running in-game event; for instance, a RPG could allow a player to craft a weapon of some sort in a set amount of time. The user may switch away from the game and perform other tasks, while still being able to invoke the transient view to check the status or his in-game craft action.\r\n\r\n - A IM application might allow the user to chat while performing another task by using the transient view to display the conversation.\r\n\r\n - A clipboard manager app might allow the user to invoke a transient view where he can save the current contents of the pasteboard, or copy previously saved items.\r\n\r\n - An iPad application could use its iPhone view controllers to present a smaller but full-featured version of itself to the user, allowing him full access to app features without leaving the current task.", "classification": "Feature (New)", "title": "Please allow iOS apps to \"grow\" popovers from the multitasking tray.", "originated": "19-Apr-2011 12:07 AM", "product_version": "4.3", "number": "9301202", "user": "me@infinite-labs.net", "reproducible": "Not Applicable", "id": 1173404}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "iPhone SDK", "description": "Summary:\r\nWith no Bluetooth device connected (as indicated by the status bar icon, and the Bluetooth settings page) EAAccessoryManager returns an EAAccessory object for a Bluetooth device that was previously connected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf no Bluetooth device is connected, [[EAAccessoryManager sharedManager] connectedAccessories] should not return an EAAccessory instance for a previously-connected Bluetooth accessory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n[[EAAccessoryManager sharedManager] connectedAccessories] sometimes returns an EAAccessory instance representing a previously-connected (but no-longer connected) Bluetooth accessory.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\niPod touch (4th generation)\r\niOS 4.3.1 (8G4)\r\n\r\nPossibly encountered on iPhone 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHere are the steps that I've gone through to diagnose the issue when it happens.

And of course, sometimes a device has problems which usually means it gets replaced.

Sometimes the listener will be copied to the latter document (which also has its own), causing this document to handle every message from the global page twice. NB: I do mean the same document, not the same tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Install the 'test' extension. Here's how the extension works:\r\nFor every document in the page that loads an external resource, the extension's injected script assigns a unique ID to the document and sends a message to the global page; the global page then sends a message back. The injected script and the global page show an alert box before sending their messages and the injected script does so again upon receiving the answer, each showing the document's unique ID.\r\n\r\n2) Now navigate to:\r\nhttp://www.glogger.mobi/userpub2.php?username=guest&i=2009_04_26_21_09_58_75441700\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTheoretically, on any webpage, this extension will produce a number of matching triples of alert boxes: 'Sending message from document i', 'Sending answer to document i', and 'Answer received by document i'.\r\nThis happens correctly with the 'test-fix' extension that uses a workaround (see note 1 below).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the above webpage, document 1 gives two notifications of reception of answer, even though the answer was sent once from the global page: the handler of the 'message' event is run twice.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1) An easy workaroud is to not register the listener to the message event if window.location.href is 'about:blank'. That's what the test-fix extension does and it shows the source of the bug.\r\n2) This hasn't anything to do with the 'beforeload' event, I'm just using it as a convenient way to assign unique IDs to document, making the demonstration clearer. But using a simpler injected script that sends its message after a setTimeout (long enough for the tab to load completely and the about:blank pages to disappear) and alerts on every message sent and received and doing the math, the number of alerts upon reception is still more than it should be, i.e. it is\r\n\r\n(# of documents in the tab) * (# of documents in the tab + # of documents with duplicate listeners).\r\n\r\nThis is what the test2 extension demonstrates (in the above web page there are 4 documents whence 20 answers received instead of the expected 16).\r\n3) I'm not sure if the creation of all these about:blank documents is necessary, but I guess not since it happens far less often in the latest WebKit builds.

Clients are a mixture of 10.6.7 and 10.5.8.\r\n\r\nMost users have network home folders, but a few have portable home directories, and a few have laptops. Many more users than actual workstations (\"hot bunking\" so to speak).\r\n\r\nAs the Admin, I have a local admin account on each workstation. User accounts don't have admin priveledges.\r\n\r\nMy local admin userID and credentials are NOT the same as the admin account ID and credentials on the server (to prevent the compromise of a single workstation from getting admin control over the server.) And my server credentials are NOT stored in the local client keychain.\r\n\r\nUsing Workgroup Manager, I am pushing Time Machine settings to each client. The settings I am pushing are consistent with those examples in the Apple Manuals (specify URL of the time machine backup destination, but not username). The exact info I'm pushing is as follows \"afp://server4.local/timemachine3\".  (The server is on a private network and not publically-accessible, so no fancy FQDN is being used, and doesn't appear to be related to my issue.)  These Workgroup Manager settings worked in getting each Client Machine to start backing up to the server destination as specified and expected.\r\n\r\nWe have strict password policies (controlled thru Workgroup Manager) that require changing passwords periodically. The users are doing this as expected.\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\nWhen the first Time Machine backup ran for each client workstation, it used the username and password of whichever user was logged in at that time to establish the credentials for that TM backup. On the server, I see those users as the owners of the TM backup sparseimages associated with each client machine.\r\n\r\nOn the clients, (using my local admin priveledges) I see an entry in the \"System\" keychain with that users's password that was in effect on the day the TM backup was first created.  TM backups continue as expected without incident.\r\n\r\nOnce the user changes their password (per the periodic password change policy), the TM password stored in the System keychain DOESN'T update. All TM backups from that day forward fail due to the password mismatch.\r\n\r\nI can manually correct this, one machine at a time, by manually updating the TM password that is stored in the \"System\" Keychain using my local Admin credentials, but that is not an optimal solution (by far).\r\n\r\nI have also tried creating the TM backup using my SERVER admin credentials, but this hasn't worked reliably for me in the past either (I'm not sure why, but I suspect it is due to AFP not working right when more than one userID is connecting to the server from the same client), and also leaves my server admin credentials on all the client machines (some of which are laptops and travel a lot), which is a security risk I am not willing to take.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Server manuals seem to suggest that backing up to a server offering Time Machine backups should \"just work\" without all this hassle, including backing up all local client files, regardless of who is logged in, and how the authentication is made. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Push TM destination/policy to client workstations thru workgroup manager.\r\n2. User logs into client workstation.  First Time Machine backup runs.  A Keychain item is silently added to the \"System\" keychain for that workstation, with the logged-in user's current password.\r\n3. Sometime later, the user changes their login password, thru normal means.\r\n4. Time Machine backups fail from this point forward, due to outdated password still being stored in the \"System\" Keychain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIMHO, Time Machine should generate and use a certificate for authentication between client and server, not the password of whichever user just happened to be logged in at the moment the first TM backup was run.\r\n\r\nAlso, storing the currently logged-in user's login password in the \"System\" Keychain when the first TM backup is kicked-off seems like a security flaw.  Suppose I'm the admin of the mac, but my user has \"priveledged\" information that they want to keep private, perhaps by using FileVault to protect their home folder.  \r\n\r\nAs the admin, I can compromise their FileVault information by seeing that their password was stored in the \"System\" Keychain under an item called Time Machine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTM not working after user changes password.\r\nUser's password exposed to admin, by being stored in the \"System\" Keychain, where the admin can view it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm filing this as a \"Serious Bug\" because it prevents Time Machine from reliably backing up multiple workstations to a OSX Server, if a periodic password change policy is used.\r\nI also think this should be considered for a \"Security Flaw\" since it is possible for someone who might be a network admin to expose individual's login password, and thus unlock their FileVaults.", "classification": "", "title": "Time Machine backup to OSX Server fails after user changes their login password", "originated": "03/30/2011", "product_version": "10.6.7 (and earlier I suspect)", "number": "9209110", "user": "cpragman@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Yes", "id": 1151402}, {"status": "Duplicate/8575409", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "Summary:\r\nThe subversion integration in Xcode 4 doesn't show the modification icons on any files if svn:externals properties are used in the repository.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Define one or more folders in a subversion repository using the svn:externals property\r\n- Checkout the repository from subversion, open it in Xcode and configure the subversion repository\r\n- Modify one or more files\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- File modification status should be shown for the changed files\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-No repository status icons are shown for the files - sometimes the icons show briefly and the disappears again.\r\n-In addition, the following entry is repeatedly written (spam flooded) in the console log: \r\nXcode[4274]\t[?T] ERROR: Your working copy returned an SVN status of \"external\" that we don't handle (yet)\r\n- Using svn from the command line works without any problems - file status is correctly shown\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nXcode 3.2.5 handled the use of svn:external properties without any problems at all\r\n\r\nNotes:", "classification": "Other Bug", "title": "Xcode 4 doesn't handle svn:externals", "originated": "30-Mar-2011", "product_version": "4.0.1", "number": "9205481", "user": "broch@infinite-loop.dk", "reproducible": "Yes", "id": 1152404}, {"status": "Duplicate/9217665", "resolved": "", "product": "Mail", "description": "Summary: Since Mac OS X 10.5 the text \"Missing Plug-in\" (formerly accompanied by a blue brick icon) shows up randomly instead of attachments.

This would shorten the initial usage pattern of a client app to: open the app, parse the pre-cached block of update data, use the app. The delay of logging in, making the request for updated data and resulting download is removed. \r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n\r\nThe notification provider (app or data vendor) would send the payload to APNS with the notification but only the notification, not the payload, would be pushed to the iOS device by APNS. The notification sent to the iOS device would contain an APNS-provided URL where iOS itself can, if it chooses, download that payload and cache it ready for the app to use when it launches. This allows iOS to intelligently control when or if the available payload is downloaded and cached. \r\n\r\nPayloads would only ever be cached when the device is on standby to prevent any disruption to running apps. More intelligent decisions could be made such as only performing the pre-cache for regularly used apps, or caching based on the usage pattern of the app. Ultimately the goal is to have as current a set of data pre-cached as possible without sacrificing battery life or incurring excessive data charges.\r\n\r\nUsage Case:\r\n\r\nTake for example an app like Evernote which I use regularly for note taking. I'll often start a note on my iPhone when I think of something, then flesh it out on my iPad when I have time and finally I'll reference the article on my Mac when coding. Today when I use the app, I first have to wait for the initial sync of data to occur before I can edit that new note. With the pre-caching addition to APNS that I've proposed here, those updates would be waiting for the app to parse in the form of an NSData block that iOS had conveniently downloaded for me earlier when a push notification was received from Evernote to inform the device there was new notes available. \r\n\r\nBoxcar is another good example because the proposed pre-caching of update data would solve two problems with Boxcar: the initial sync delay and the fact that after I see a push notification from Boxcar, that notice is not immediately viewable in the app. If I receive a push notification from Boxcar to tell me of a new event, I naturally expect to see that event waiting for me in the list of notifications when I start the app. Instead, after seeing the push notification and starting the app I have to wait for Boxcar the app to catch up with the already received push notification. If that push notification also included a way for iOS to download the app-data payload for that, and other new, notifications then the updates would be ready and waiting for me when I started Boxcar after receiving the notification. \r\n\r\nAPI:\r\n\r\nFor developers the implementation would be simple: include a new key/value pair in the options dictionary that is given to the app in the existing appDidFinishLaunching:withOptions method. These new key/value pairs would allow the developer to access the latest pre-cached data block and state data such as when the block was downloaded, etc. The app then takes a look at the data, validates it and decides whether to parse and use the pre-cached payload or discard it. The point is that parsing this already-downloaded block of data is going to be much quicker than logging in and downloading updates when the app launches. Of course, a normal login and refresh would follow but at least the app is (more) ready to use when the user launches it to consume new data. \r\n\r\nMore Information:\r\n\r\nhttp://scotchandcode.com/2011/03/28/ios-push-notification-enhancement-pre-cached-update-payloads/", "classification": "Feature (New)", "title": "iOS Push Notification Enhancement: Pre-Cached Data Payloads", "originated": "29-Mar-2011 06:45 AM", "product_version": "", "number": "9197889", "user": "jwilson@lithiumcorp.com", "reproducible": "", "id": 1145406}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Xcode", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode and iOS SDK update for 4.3.1 seemingly introduced an issue when using the compiler flag objc-nonfragile-abi2.

Deleting the expired certificate is fruitless because Xcode restores it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached set of screenshots. [OpenRadar readers, screenshots are at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14191/bug-9173280-screenshots.zip]\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to do a device build in Xcode, it fails due to a code signing error.

Create a folder and make it an AFP share point (turn off Spotlight indexing for one less ACL in the mix)\r\n2. Add a user to the folder ACL (a local, OD, or AD, doesn't matter), in this test case, Admin (501), the defaults permissions are fine (Read Only, Inheritance on)\r\n3. Save and apply rights to folder\r\n4. Create a test document  in TextEdit (on the server to eliminate OS X Client from the ACL equation) and save to folder created in step 1, you could also just touch a new filename too.\r\n5. Duplicate the file in Finder, duplicate the duplicate, etc...\r\n6. Examine the folder with ls -le, the original file will have no ACL, the duplicate will have ACLs applied, duplicates will start to have ACLs repeating/duplicating and \"stacking up\"\r\n7. When the ACLs gets long enough (esp. on an app) Finder will crash when copying\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nACL methods are aware of an existing duplicate ACEs and do not append new ACEs to the ACL\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nACLs are duplicated and appended until Finder is unable to work with the file (Copy, get Info) without crashing\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n10.6, 10.6.2, bug not present, results were consistent and as expected. \r\nExample permissions from the test file when duplicated in 10.6 or 10.6.2:\r\n0: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n\r\n10.6.3 (and into 10.6.4) introduced the behavior of adding a Write ACE to the duplication of a file that only had a Read ACE on it, example output:\r\n\r\n1st duplication (of file with no ACL):\r\n0: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n\r\n2nd copy (of file above):\r\n0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n1: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n\r\n3rd, 4th copy, etc\u2026 did not duplicate past these two ACEs, why write rights were included is a mystery, it's as if the compliment from the Unix permissions were added because administrator is doing the copying on this file? Bizarre. \r\n\r\nAlso Finder starts listing _3_ ACEs on a file that ls -le only lists with _2_, Finder saying this ghost ACE is \"Custom\".\r\n\r\n10.6.5 introduced a new level of duplication, now not only was an errant Write ACE being added to a Read only ACE, but now those entries were being duplicated as well.\r\nExample:\r\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 administrator  admin  4 Mar 18 17:19 test copy 2.txt\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 1: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 2: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n\r\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 administrator  admin  4 Mar 18 17:19 test copy 3.txt\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 1: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 2: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 3: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 4: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n\r\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 administrator  admin  4 Mar 18 17:19 test copy 4.txt\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 1: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 2: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 3: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 4: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 5: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 6: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n\r\n10.6.6 continued this behavior, which becomes fatal for Finder when copying/duplicating packages and Applicaion bundles in a folder with and ACL, Finder will become overwhelmed with the length of the ACL by the 3rd copy and fail, resulting in a truncated application or package and error -41. See the movie called \"10.6.6 ACL Chess.app.mov\", even one duplication in a folder with one ACL results in a file in the Chess.app have 12 ACEs!\r\n\r\n10.6.6 does not address or change the duplication behavior introduced in 10.6.5, or the errant addition of Write rights to what should be a Read ACE introduced in 10.6.3\r\n\r\nWhen \"cp -p\" is used to copy the errant ACEs are purged and properly reflect the ACL of the parent folder. Seems to be Finder's problem.\r\n\r\n21-Mar-2011 11:47 AM Joel Bruner:\r\nFurther regression testing notes, AFP need not be involved, and client will behave the same as well when inheritance is turned on  (file_inherit,directory_inherit), just make the folder, apply an ACL with chmod, and Finder will duplicate ACEs without proper checking and duplicates will occur to the point of Finder error -41 on applications and packages.\r\n\r\nWhile this bug affects both client and server, only server makes it easily possible by turning inheritance on by default when using the Server Admin AFP panel, whereas Finder does not turn on inheritance in it's ACLs that are added by Finder\r\n\r\nCreate a new folder in the root (to avoid any other possible ACL permissions, permission interactions), logged in as administrator (501) - you can also be logged in as anyone else who has write permissions to the folder.\r\n\r\nApply the folder ACLs (the same that server Server Manager would apply with inheritance on) using chmod:\r\n1. mkdir ~/chmodACLTest\r\n2. chmod +a \"administrator allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\"  ~/chmodACLTest\r\n3. Copy an application like Chess.app into the folder with Finder, duplicate/copy and recopy the copy, the 3rd duplicate will fail with Error -41 because ACLs are stacking up.\r\n# for a simple file experiment\r\n4. touch ~/chmodACLTest/test \r\n5. Go to Finder and duplicate the test file and its duplicates.\r\nInspect permissions in Finder and in addition to Read, the erroneous Write ACE is labeled Custom in Finder.\r\n\r\nInspect with Terminal:\r\n\r\n$ ls -led ~/chmodACLTest\r\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 6 administrator  admin  204 Mar 21 10:29 chmodACLTest\r\n 0: user:administrator allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\r\n 1: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit\r\n\r\n$ ls -le\r\ntotal 0\r\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 administrator  admin  0 Mar 21 10:28 test\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 administrator  admin  0 Mar 21 10:28 test copy\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 1: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 2: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 administrator  admin  0 Mar 21 10:28 test copy 2\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 1: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 2: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 3: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 4: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n-rw-r--r--+ 1 administrator  admin  0 Mar 21 10:28 test copy 3\r\n 0: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 1: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 2: user:administrator inherited allow write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\r\n 3: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 4: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 5: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 6: user:administrator inherited allow read,execute,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\r\n 7: user:_spotlight inherited allow read,execute\r\n\r\nNotes on Admin's ACL being Read Only vs. Unix permissions:\r\nYou can also give admin write permissions in the ACL and the same behavior will occur, while it seems like a poor example to have the same user duplicating the file having Read Only in the ACL, it should and is possible, because the Unix permissions allow this, what the example highlights is that a Write ACE is inexplicably written when that is not supposed to be inherited from the parent folder.", "classification": "Serious Bug", "title": "Finder: Inherited ACL Duplication", "originated": "20-Mar-2011 12:37 PM", "product_version": "10.6.7/10J869", "number": "9160099", "user": "brunerd@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1138407}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "Xcode 4's Scheme drop down menu would be much more useable if it was split into two menus - one to select the Scheme, and one to select the Destination.\r\n\r\nAs it is, for an iOS target with a deployment target of 4.0 you get 7 separate menu items for every single scheme which very quickly clogs the menu and makes it difficult to quickly change schemes.

Titles like The Objective-C Programming Language, iPhone Human Interface Guidelines, and the Cocoa Fundamentals Guide are essential reading for all developers, both beginner and advanced. As I began learning about Xcode 4, of course I turned to the excellent User Guide.\r\n\r\nThese guides typically span many chapters when sections that cover a wide range of topics. And this is how you navigate through those chapters:\r\n\r\nhttp://furbo.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Unmanaged_complexity.png\r\n\r\nThe pity here is that someone has forgotten that a Table of Contents tells a much more important story than the individual chapters. A roadmap lets you visit the destinations efficiently.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of how painful this is, try finding the recommended Singleton implementation in the Cocoa Fundamentals Guide using the Jump Bar.\r\n\r\nOf course the documentation viewer has a search function, but even that's a bit laborious because you have to click on a lot of disclosure triangles to find the right item in the results. Why aren't the relevant results opened automatically? (And, yes, option clicking the disclosure triangle can be used to achieve this goal, but the question still remains: why isn't this the default action?)\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem here and with the method names in the class documentation, is that a deep hierarchy is too hard to navigate. Present the information in a single list and it becomes much more useful. Imagine how bad the code editor navigation would be if it presented a hierarchy based upon classes, properties and methods. It's flattened into a single menu for a reason: and those same reasons exist in the documentation viewer.\r\n\r\nThe Jump Bar is a great addition to Xcode, but it's true power lies in having a predictable end point. With code, that end point is a function, property or method. With documentation, that end point is elusive: it varies depending both with the type and the structure of the documentation you're viewing. And that's a real problem when you're looking for something.\r\n\r\nMore information (including screenshots) at: http://furbo.org/?p=334", "classification": "Serious Bug", "title": "BUG: The documentation viewer does not show a Table of Contents", "originated": "", "product_version": "Xcode 4.0 / 4A304a", "number": "9149683", "user": "craig.hockenberry@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1141405}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "Summary: The new Jump Bar does not show method names\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open the documentation page (for example, UIWindow).\r\n2) Try to find a popup menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere would be a menu that lists all of the class' methods.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere's no menu.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nLet's say we're looking for some background on what happens when a new -rootViewController instance is assigned. After opening the documentation page for the UIWindow class, there aren't any controls to show the methods.\r\n\r\nBesides being a pain in the butt, this is wholly inconsistent with the behavior in the code editor which shows a list of functions, properties and methods after the class name.\r\n\r\n(Note that typing \"ro\" is enough to select \"rootViewController\" in the code editor's popup menu. That, followed by the enter key gets you to the code of interest.)\r\n\r\nFrom a developer's point-of-view, the header files and the documentation page go hand-in-hand. Make the UI affordances the same and we don't have to think about whether we're looking at code or the words that describe it.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get to the rootViewController documentation with the Jump Bar. Unfortunately, it takes a lot more effort than in the code editor: you have to click on the class name, and then move the mouse until the subcategories appear. Choose \"Instance Methods\" and wonder why rootViewController isn't there. Then move the mouse back and try Properties.\r\n\r\nAnd forget about navigating these lists quickly and easily with the keyboard as you can with the code editor.\r\n\r\nMore information (including screenshots) at: http://furbo.org/?p=334", "classification": "Serious Bug", "title": "BUG: Documentation viewer does not have a popup showing method names", "originated": "", "product_version": "Xcode 4.0 / 4A304a", "number": "9149638", "user": "craig.hockenberry@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1137405}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nShift option click can't be used to avoid popup help\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHold down shift and option while clicking on a symbol.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe documentation viewer should appear without popup help appearing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhen you hold down the option key and click on a symbol in Xcode, you see a popup window with a summary of the symbol that was clicked.\r\n\r\nFor novices, this window has some utility\u2014it provides a simple way for them to dig into what is probably unfamiliar territory (\"What's a UIWindow anyway?\").\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this window becomes a roadblock for experienced developers.

I use the same pair of headphones (the apple headphones that came with my iphone4) with either phone.  I am on a great many conference calls for my job, and there is an EXTREMELY frustrating difference between how the two phones handle the headphone button when that button is pressed during a call:  The blackberry mutes or unmutes the microphone when the headphone button is pressed, whereas the iphone ends the call.  (note that the blackberry CAN end the call via the headphone button, with a long press of the button)\r\n\r\nThis is one case where I find the blackberry's functionality to be far superior than the iphone. (note that, when the blackberry is ringing the headphone button answers the call, just like the iphone does.  Ditto for the ability to pause/play music - both handsets behave identically.)   The ability to quickly mute/unmute your microphone via hardware is CRUCIAL given the likelihood that I may be using another app (email, messages, safari) while I'm on the conference call, not to mention that I might keep the handset in my pocket.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. plug apple headphones into iphone\r\n2. dial into an important conference call\r\n3. mute your microphone by tapping the onscreen \"Mute\" button\r\n4. while the call is underway, open up your calendar and read the agenda for the meeting.  Then press the sleep button and put the iphone in your pocket as you make some coffee, walk down the hall to pick up something off the printer, etc (while still listening to the ongoing conference call)\r\n5. at some point in the conference call, a crucial question is directed at you\r\n6. habitually press the headphone button to unmute yourself\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou are unmuted and able to seamlessly join the conversation.\r\n(as would be the case if you were carrying out the exact same steps with your blackberry)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou unintentionally hang up on your coworkers or your customer.  You then spend a very long 30 seconds rejoining the conference call, at which point you apologize and explain that you accidentally pushed the hangup button on your iphone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't believe this is a regression, I'm pretty sure it's been true of every iphone since day one.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEven if you avoided the accidental hangup that I describe above, you would STILL have to spend several seconds getting the iphone out of your pocket, press the wake button, swipe to unlock, tap the \"return to call\" button (since you're still in the calendar app...), tap the unmute button.  As the other callers have been waiting for your response, you then apologize and explain that \"sorry, I was on mute and it took me awhile to get my iphone unmuted.\"\r\n\r\nThis may seem trivial, but for someone who is on a LOT of conference calls, it's a massive headache.", "classification": "UI/Usability", "title": "PLEASE allow the headphone button to mute the iphone microphone during a call!", "originated": "15-Mar-2011 10:27 AM", "product_version": "4.3.1", "number": "9135184", "user": "rob.worman@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1174412}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen Xcode 4 enters an conflicted state, it pops a window titled \"Internal Error\".

It appears that the logical place to do this is in the Test pre and post actions, using a Run Script action.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would appear that the post-action is actually run before the tests have finished running, making it essentially useless (in my case, the server I started in my pre-action would be terminated while the tests were still running causing them to fail).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Xcode 4 project with unit tests.

The test bundle and app target will be built, you will hear \"Running pre action\" and then almost immediately, \"Running post action\".

Managed objects must be saved in a context before the objectID can be used.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense since the managed objects need to be moved from private storage (NSManagedObjectContext) to public storage (NSPersistentStore) before they can be shared.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the -save: message also causes any managed objects in the undo stack to be removed. From the \"Memory Management Using Core Data\" section of the same guide:\r\n\r\n\"Managed objects that have pending changes (insertions, deletions, or updates) are retained by their context until their context is sent a save:, reset , rollback, or dealloc message, or the appropriate number of undos to undo the change.\"\r\n\r\nI've tried several things to work around this limitation, and everything eventually leads back to bulk of the work happening on the main thread (and spinning beach balls.)\r\n\r\nIdeally, there should be a way to move the contents of -insertedObjects, -deletedObjects and -updatedObjects from one NSManagedObjectContext to another (across threads.)

This is readily demonstrated by these two example sentences:\r\n\r\n* \"The computer runs.\" Singular subject \"computer\" (no final \"s\"), singular verb \"runs\" (final \"s\")\r\n* \"The computers run.\" Plural subject \"computers\" (marked by the final \"s\"), plural verb \"run\" (no final \"s\").\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis made me take a triple-take the first time I read it.

A more reliable approach is to open the v3.0.3 pmdoc in v3.0.4, select the package that no longer is under its choice, copy the identifier shown, and then edit the XML files to match that value. This might not work in all cases, but it fixed my problem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could have a future v3.0.5:\r\n* upgrade the v3.0.3 files to be openable by v3.0.4 / v3.0.5\r\n* provide a \"Check for Compatibility\" option that will advise of package identifiers that will be interpreted differently by v3.0.3 and later versions.", "classification": "Crash/Hang/Data Loss", "title": "PackageMaker v3.0.4/179 mangles .pmdocs created by v3.0.3/174", "originated": "04-Feb-2011 01:22 AM", "product_version": "v3.0.4/179", "number": "8957939", "user": "jeremyw.sherman@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 1096403}, {"status": "Closed", "resolved": "2/03/2012", "product": "iOS", "description": "04-Feb-2011 02:46 PM Alan Rogers:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen I search for 'myanus' in the Google Maps app, it gets auto-corrected to 'Bi\u2019r Y\u016bnus'.\r\n\r\nThis is all fine, however when you then try to delete this auto correction, you can't.

If the receiver doesn't implement those protocols, it should call [[self nextResponder] keyPressed:aKey withEvent:anEvent]; This is a little bit \"magical\" or \"heavy\" relative to the other UIResponder methods, but it seems a logical place to put this because then subclasses could easily handle some exceptional case (checking for a modifier key being down or whatever) and then simply call super to get the usual behavior thus allowing relatively easy subclassing of UITextField, UITextView, etc just to add some kind of special keyboard-centric magic if necessary. (Although to be honest, I'm not sure what magic that'd be given that keyboard usage should be considered rare/unusual on iOS devices.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDefine UIKey (or something like it) with an API something like this (partly inspired by some of the things available via NSEvent in AppKit):\r\n\r\ntypedef enum {\r\n\tUIKeyTypeCharacter,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeUpArrow,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeDownArrow,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeLeftArrow,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeRightArrow,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeReturn,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeEnter,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeHome,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeInsert,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeDelete,\r\n\tUIKeyTypeEnd,\r\n\tUIKeyTypePageUp,\r\n\tUIKeyTypePageDown,\r\n\tetc\u2026\r\n} UIKeyType;\r\n\r\n@interface UIKey : NSObject\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) UIKeyType type;\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *characters; // could be nil\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *charactersWithModifiers; // could be nil\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, getter=isRepeat) BOOL repeat;\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, getter=isCapslockEnabled) BOOL capslockEnabled;\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, getter=isShiftKeyPressed) BOOL shiftKeyPressed;\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, getter=isControlKeyPressed) BOOL controlKeyPressed;\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, getter=isOptionKeyPressed) BOOL optionKeyPressed;\r\n@property (nonatomic, readonly, getter=isCommandKeyPressed) BOOL commandKeyPressed;\r\netc\u2026\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a key is pressed on the keyboard, UIApplication would be notified, a UIEvent created/updated, and then the app's keyWindow is given the event which then travels down that window's responder chain (if any) until something (if anything) handles it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'd propose adding the following informal protocol:\r\n\r\n@interface NSObject (UIResponderStandardKeyboardActions)\r\n- (void)cancel:(id)sender;\r\n- (void)commit:(id)sender;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore UIWindow sends the keyPressed event down the responder chain, it could check to see if a couple of standard conditions are true, and if they are, send one of these actions to the first responder instead. (Could use UIResponder's canPerformAction:withSender: to determine if they should even be sent.)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these would be to map a couple of \"standard\" keyboard combos in an easy way. The idea is that -cancel: would be sent if ESC is pressed (this is similar to the idea of cancelOperation: in AppKit). -commit: could be sent if the user presses CMD-Return or the Enter key, since that's a rather common convention as well.

The only available API is ABPersonSetImageData(\u2026), which seems to set both images to the same value.\r\n\r\nB) It is not possible to know which is the crop rect that was applied to the original image to obtain the thumbnail.\r\n\r\nThese two features would be useful, for example, to support the following use-cases:\r\n\r\nA) the user assigns a pic to a contact from a third party application using some custom controller (not the system AddressBookUI), selecting some portion of a larger image; the information about such larger image is lost (or saved to the image library but without any reference to the contact), so it won't be possible for the user to adjust the image later\r\n\r\nB) the user needs to adjust (scale/move) a contact thumbnail that she knows has been cropped from a larger image. This functionality can't be provided outside AddressBookUI because the crop rect of the thumbnail is unknown. Image processing techniques (template matching) could be used in principle to locate the thumbnail within the large image, but this is a heavy workaround to obtain (an approximation of) a simple piece of information which is possibly already stored somewhere privately in the AB database.\r\n\r\nTo fix these problems, it would be sufficient to:\r\n\r\nA) include a new function:\r\n\r\nbool ABPersonSetImageDataWithThumbnail (ABRecordRef person, CFDataRef oriImageData, CGRect cropRect, CFErrorRef *error);\r\n\r\nwhere all the arguments are like in the existing \"ABPersonSetImageData\", but what is passed as input (oriImageData) is the original full size image; the thumbnail image will be implicitly assigned cropping the portion identified by \"cropRect\". So basically this function assigns both the thumbnail and the full size image, specifying only the latter, and giving the crop rect of the former\r\n\r\nB) include a new function:\r\n\r\nbool ABPersonGetImageCropRect(ABRecordRef person, CGRect *cropRect)\r\n\r\nwhich returns TRUE iff the record for \"person\" actually has two different images (thumbnail and full size), returning in cropRect the crop rect of the thumbnail in the large image.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this extension.\r\n\r\nPierangelo", "classification": "enhancement request", "title": "Missing AddressBook API to deal with thumbnail VS full-size contact pics", "originated": "Jan 15, 2011", "product_version": "4.x", "number": "8869784", "user": "mabene@gmail.com", "reproducible": "not applicable", "id": 1056401}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "Documentation", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe \"Test the Installation Process\" section of the \"Submitting to the Mac App Store\" document is incomplete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions on the developer web site:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/documents/submitting.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010572-CH16-SW7\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should have enough information to install and launch your application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe instructions only test that the installer package can be read and written to the Applications folder.

The bug seems to be brought out when the OpenAL buffer queue system gets starved. This bug is tricky to reproduce, but usually happens when a system is under stress and buffer queuing can't keep up. Usually in those cases, I also do more queries to OpenAL to find out the state of OpenAL which probably makes the problem worst.\r\n\r\nAttached is a mostly reproducible test program. It uses a very small number of buffers and very small buffers to try to increase the chance of a problem. Sometimes adding more overhead to the program helps trigger the crash.

However, the dragging mask returned by -draggingSourceOperationMask comes out as a 32-bit unsigned int value, or only the bottom 4 bytes of an unsigned long. This means that on 64-bit systems, the dragging mask returned by this method will NEVER equal NSDragOperationEvery (aka NSUIntegerMax), the documented return value when no modifier keys are pressed.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to cast NSDragOperationEvery as a 32-bit value (e.g. unsigned int) before comparing. However, this problem is deceptively invisible and complex, and I worry that the 32/64-bit issues involved are likely beyond many developers that may get bit by this.

Run the app, perform a simple drag which causes the method to fire, and observe the inequality:\r\n      0xffffffff ?= 0xffffffffffffffff\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\n\r\nExamining -draggingSourceOperationMask in NSDragManager.m from AppKit-1038 via Clownfish revealed a potential cause: the \"sourceOperationMask\" variable (the value to be returned) is passed by reference to CoreDragGetAllowableActions(), which expects to write to a CoreDragActions, a typedef for UInt32.

I had to completely delete the folder and install the app again before it properly created /Applications/RapidWeaver.\r\n\r\nI believe that *no* application not installed through the App Store should be removed - an existing version that was installed manually should always be renamed rather than overwritten.  Reasonable people could debate that point. However, when the app is placed in a sub-folder that's a clear sign that this is a user who knows what they're doing and expects to run several versions at once.

If you sell licenses for your app both on and outside the Mac App Store, should the bundle IDs for the two versions be the same or different?\r\n\r\nThe \"Information Property List Key Reference\" document implies that the same CFBundleIdentifier should be used for different versions, which makes sense since documents should open with the latest version of an app instead of needing to be re-associated with every new version. The documentation says, \"This key does not uniquely identify a specific bundle in the file system, as multiple copies of an application with the same or different version may exist.\" \r\n\r\nThe \"Submitting to the Mac App Store\" document doesn't say anything about the uniqueness outside the bundle: \"Ensure that every bundle identifier is unique within your application bundle.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical Q&A QA1373 says \"This key is a unique identifier for your application on the system.

The reason it has the same bundle ID is that it's the same app, and when the user buys it from the Mac App Store, the user expects the purchase to replace the trial version. But the App Store app shows that app as \"Installed\" and does not give an option to buy it. There should be a way to buy it, or at least to uninstall the app so the user can buy the full version. The existing way, showing an app as \"Installed\" even though the user did not purchase it through the Mac App Store, is confusing to users and causes me to get more support emails over this issue. Users might assume that they will get free updates through the MAS because it's \"Installed\" or be able to buy it again without being charged, as that is the iOS App Store model.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Sound Studio 4.0.3 from http://felttip.com/downloads/sound_studio_4.0.3.zip.\r\n2. Extract the app and place it in /Applications.\r\n3. Open the Mac App Store app and search for Sound Studio.\r\n4. Verify that Sound Studio is in the search results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app should show its purchase price and allow it to be bought, because the user has not yet bought the app from the Mac App Store. (This is only valid if the version number in the App Store is older than the one in the copy of the app on the disk. As of 1/8/11, this is true.)\r\n\r\nActual Results: The app is shown as Installed and cannot be bought, even though it's a trial version, because the bundle ID is the same and the version on the disk is equal or newer than the version in the App Store.\r\n\r\nRegression: If the version of the app in the App Store is updated to be newer than any downloadable trial version, then the app can be bought. If the app is put in the Trash, the app can be bought. \r\n\r\nNotes: Using a different bundle ID would also be confusing to the user because there would be two apps that are functionally identical but are treated as two separate apps by the system.

If a customer sees an app that piques their interest, and can try it free for (say) 14 days, they\u2019re far more likely to decide that it\u2019s worth the money than if they only get to look at screenshots (or even movies) of it. There\u2019s no better way for a customer to get a feel for the app than to use it, and likewise, there\u2019s no better way for a developer to hook a customer than with a free trial which sells the polish of the app.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison, I have personally found that the iBooks samples to be the perfect hook. Once I\u2019ve read the first few pages I\u2019m far more likely to pay to read the rest. The same thing happens in a physical book store: I prefer buying physical books in a brick and mortar store (or online, if they have selected a good sample chapter) because I can leaf through and get some experience with the writing, whether it says something that intrigues me, whether it\u2019s written in a way that I will want to continue reading. I think this is exactly analogous to the situation with apps in the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nI have long felt that this was a serious lack in the iOS App Store, but if anything it\u2019s even more so in the Mac App Store due to the increased scope of the applications; increased development time and resources mean higher overheads, which means that a higher price is going to be required to be profitable. And of course profitable (without being _over_priced) apps are good for everyone: the users get good apps, developers get money\u2014and so does Apple, both through the 30% cut and the increased investment by users in their Macs (and their next Mac, and the one after that, plus one for their parents and kids and \u2026).\r\n\r\nIn addition, this would be an excellent opportunity for Apple to standardize some conventions with trials to avoid confusing a na\u00efve userbase. For example, Apple could mandate user interface elements (perhaps even ones provided by Apple specifically for this purpose via new APIs) which state, clearly, how much longer is left in the trial. Apple-provided UI elements would also make it easy for the customer to buy the full version from within it. This could even occur outside the app\u2019s address space to ensure that nothing can interfere with the transaction, in a manner similar to how the Dock can interact with an application externally to it.\r\n\r\nIf this proved successful\u2014as I believe it will\u2014it would then be a good starting point to introduce something similar on the iOS App Store, if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A", "classification": "Feature (New)", "title": "The benefit of time-limited Mac App Store trials", "originated": "07-Jan-2011 05:22 PM", "product_version": "Mac OS X 10.6.6", "number": "8836036", "user": "rix.rob@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Not Applicable", "id": 1013401}, {"status": "Duplicate/7276618", "resolved": "", "product": "Developer Tools", "description": "Summary:\r\nAttempting to refactor the name of a class results in reproducible exceptions and (if you click Continue) hangs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.

If you add a check for that file just being present (no verification needed, as this is not about piracy but about the user experience well-intentioned users experience and the repercussions for developers if it stays broken like this) before showing the app as \"Installed\" everything would be better.\r\n\r\nSuggested Criteria to validate that an app is installed:\r\n\r\n1.

An obvious example in iOS would be requiring different view controller behaviour depending on screen orientation. Traditional C enumerations would look like this:\r\n\r\nenum { GLScreenOrientationLandscape, GLScreenOrientationPortrait };\r\n\r\nbut these have various problems: binary compatibility is hard, the size of storage used is not well-defined (hence Foundation using typedefs for its enums), the types are unbounded, nonsensical operations are possible like:\r\n\r\nx = GLScreenOrientationLandscape * GLScreenOrientationPortrait;\r\n\r\nand most annoyingly for Objective-C code, to work with these enums means repetitive, error-prone and inefficient boxing code using NSNumber or NSValue.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\nAn Objective-C specific @enum type, which creates static, immutable instances. So you could have:\r\n\r\n@enum GLScreenOrientation {Landscape, Portrait};\r\n\r\nwhich creates a class like this:\r\n\r\n@interface GLScreenOrientation: NSObject <NSCopying>\r\n+ (GLScreenOrientation *)Landscape;\r\n+ (GLScreenOrientation *)Portrait;\r\n+ (NSSet *)values;\r\n@end\r\n\r\nBenefits: the main benefit is code brevity. Here is some code using C enums:\r\n\r\nNSNumber *viewHeight = [heights objectForKey: [NSNumber numberWithInteger: GLScreenOrientationLandscape]];\r\n\r\nif ([orientation integerValue] == GLScreenOrientationLandscape) {\r\n\r\nswitch ([orientation integerValue]) {\r\ncase (GLScreenOrientationLandscape):\r\nbreak;\r\ncase (GLScreenOrientationPortrait):\r\nbreak;\r\ndefault: //handle surprising value\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor (NSInteger i=GLScreenOrientationLandscape; i <=GLScreenOrientationPortrait; i++) {\r\n  // hope I got those the right way around, that there are no gaps, and that I didn't miss any....\r\n}\r\n\r\nand a case-by-case replacement with my proposed enumeration type:\r\n\r\nNSNumber *viewHeight = [heights objectForKey: [GLScreenOrientation Landscape]];\r\n\r\nif (orientation == [GLScreenOrientation Landscape]) //as the instances are static, this is permitted\r\n\r\nif (orientation == [GLScreenOrientation Landscape]) {}\r\nelse if (orientation == [GLScreenOrientation Portrait]) {}\r\n//no need to handle the default case, there isn't one\r\n\r\nfor (GLScreenOrientation *orientation in [GLScreenOrientation values]) {}\r\n\r\nThe other benefit is safety. Notice that in the case of the switch and for expressions, using C enumerated types is awkward because in each case you might encounter values that aren't part of the enumeration. Using my proposed type, this problem is mitigated. It is not possible to request a value that isn't part of the enumeration because you are restricted to using the class methods. The use of the new types can be checked by the compiler in a way that C-style enums can't: if your code expects a GLScreenOrientation instance, then that is what it must get.\r\n\r\nThe amount of storage used in each case isn't going to differ much, as the enumeration instances are Flyweights so there just needs to be one static instance per value written into the compiled object.", "classification": "Enhancement", "title": "Request for a simple, Foundation-friendly enumerated type", "originated": "16/12/2010", "product_version": "N/A", "number": "8779321", "user": "iamleeg@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Not Applicable", "id": 969401}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing the example code ImageClient, I am unable to authenticate through a Squid proxy that only offers NTLM authentication when in CFNetwork mode.

The fact that only the application that has written a password to a keychain may later on access it (ACL restriction) is a great benefit in general, but it is a real pain if you want to develop applications that \"work\" on user's keychains, e.g. syncing passwords with some non OS X password services, transferring passwords between keychains, etc. In that case each access to the password of a password entry (or the private key of a private key entry) causes a dialog to be displayed. While these dialogs are a security feature in general, there are situations where they make useful software development impossible, since I cannot expect a user with 100+ items in a keychain to hit that dialog button 100+ times to allow an application to read all its password.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThe solution is as simple as adding two tiny features. First one is bulk operation. Instead of forcing the app to request permission for each item, the app can perform a bulk operation and the dialog will ask the user if the application in question may access 100+ items in the keychain (allowing the user to see a list of all items, if he really cares for it). This way the user once gives permission, not 100+ times. The second solution is even better and even more simple to integrate into the current code: A keychain has a *global ACL* with trusted applications. Trusted applications are allowed to bypass the ACLs for individual keychain items. If an application is in the global ACL, access is equal as if it was in the ACL of every existing keychain item. I know that this is somewhat risky, but adding an app to the global ACL doesn't have to be easy or user friendly. If it is necessary to perform complicated steps via keychain access, that would be acceptable, after all a user has to perform those steps only once in most cases. Just like item ACLs the hash of the application is verified, so when it changes, the system will ask the user again. A nice byproduct of the global ACL is that certain command line utilities can be added to that list, finally allowing certain keychain operations on headless systems that are currently really painful or impossible to implement.\r\n\r\nThis feature has been missed by developers for as long as keychain exists, so over a decade. Already 2006 people like Ken McLeod or Perry the Cynic have noted on the CDSA mailing list that those kind of features are really missing, e.g.\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/apple-cdsa/2006/Aug/msg00013.html\r\n\r\nand there are plenty of developers requesting them on that list over and over again, and still after so many years, nothing has happened, nothing has been improved. With the Internet always around and with services in the cloud, a locked up system like the current security API and keychains is just outdated. And if Apple is not dealing with that issue, I'm afraid that sooner or later some alternative API from some company like 1Password.com will be offered and all major applications will migrate to that API istead.\r\n\r\nI know that you can write CDSA plugins, but those are not treated equally in all aspects and would not be transparent to all applications that use Sec* API calls. Further a storage plugin would not solve the problems, since an application still has to understand the internal \"format\" of a keychain file... in that case the app can as well directly operate on those files and bypass the security framework altogether.", "classification": "Feature (New)", "title": "Allow Bulk Operations on Keychains and Allow Trusted Helper Apps for Keychains", "originated":

Now imagine we have a single global input the user can adjust (eg. amount of funk in motion). Because funk affects all three parts of the body, we have to expose three input variables on three JS patches, publish those three input and use a splitter just to get a single number to all three parts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be nice to be able to use a single global variable within each JS patch, and maybe create a top-level controller JS that sets that value. eg. _root.funkValue = 0.5; Each individual body part would then just reference the same global variable (_root.funkValue) and this reduces the need for exposing inputs, publishing them, splitting them, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs well as making QTZ patches simpler and easier to build, this would reduce execution time too. Imagine each JS patch needs to calculate the delta time between frame renders, currently each JS patch needs it's own Time input, and needs to calculate the deltaTime between frames. With one overall Controller JS patch doing this calculation and passing the deltaTime in a global var, this cuts the execution time within JS.\r\n\r\nNote that this request is specifically for JS global vars. Other bug reports may be asking for a non-JS global var type solution, which satisfies similar concerns but introduces problems to do with execution order etc. I would argue that as a JS developer, it is my responsibility to consider execution order, therefore I would need to know to make my top-level Controller JS patch execution first (by attaching it to a low-numbered layer) so that it updates the global variable _before_ each macro patch's JS patches.\r\n\r\nAlso consider that this technique could help encourage a MVC paradigm within Quartz Composer. Moving computation and control to a separate top-level helps ensure the individual macro parts are kept focussed on the job they're supposed to (eg. bouncing head, gyrating body and dancing legs).", "classification": "Enhancement", "title": "Composition-wide global object or variables in QC JS patches", "originated": "08-Dec-2010", "product_version": "Quartz Composer 4.0", "number": "8743194", "user": "signwave@gmail.com", "reproducible": "n/a", "id": 953401}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "iPhone SDK", "description": "At http://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action , there are a couple of videos on the right \r\n\r\nHow-To's\r\n\r\nObtaining your Certificate\r\nView video\r\n\r\nAssigning Devices\r\nView video\r\n\r\nCreating your App IDs\r\nView video\r\n\r\nCreating Provisioning Profiles\r\nView video\r\n\r\nThey seem to be outdated since Xcode does the job.

This may be solvable with some extensions to the compiler and ObjC syntax without major language changes.\r\n\r\nIn the current ObjC error handling system, you get back both a value, which is typically testable as a boolean NO and an NSError by-ref. This means we are getting back two values when really only one value can be valid. All sorts of rules have to be made about whether you can look at *outError and nothing prevents/warns the user that they are doing it wrong other than documented convention (which people can accidentally mess up).\r\n\r\nConsider, though, if ObjC had simple syntactic sugar for optional types (at least this one case) for errors. It might look like:\r\n\r\n    - (@error id)doSomething;\r\n\r\nWith '@error id' being a type you could typedef or use as the type of a local variable/ivar/whatever.\r\n\r\nThe compiler would synthesize a C union return type of {NSError *error; X value;} for the type X. It would also handle the cases:\r\n\r\n- Using the synthesized union as a conditional would evaluate (u.error == nil).\r\n- Using the synthesized union as Rvalue of type X would evaluate as (u.value).\r\n- The static analyzer would also _warn_ if the result was interpreted as a value on a branch where error isn't guaranteed to be nil (\"Return value evaluated without checking for errors\"). This would be huge.\r\n- In the body of a method/function, return X would cons up a union with the value.\r\n- In the body of a method/function, @error [NSError ...] would cons up a union with the error (so you would \"return @error ... something making an NSError *...;\" to bail.\r\n\r\nThis would avoid the issue of outError being NULL (so having to check before filling it out), *outError getting stomped and devs looking at its contents when they shouldn't and devs looking at the return code when really an error happened.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are holes in this approach, but I think it is worth considering and would have lots of benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n28-Nov-2010 01:35 PM Timothy Wood:\r\nOh, one other case this would be nice for is that you could do \"@error void\".

Next, Singapore starts its calendar on Mondays instead of Sundays (currently wrongly reflected by the iPhone's regional settings, filed bug report #8103166).\r\n\r\nCould you please map the Singapore App Store localization to Australia English instead, because it's really weird for people here in Singapore to see 24-hour times in app's screenshots.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:", "classification": "Other Bug", "title": "Singapore App Store should map to 'Australian English' localisation", "originated": "14-Nov-2010 05:16 PM", "product_version": "All", "number": "8666476", "user": "mail.junjie@gmail.com", "reproducible": "N/A", "id": 867401}, {"status": "", "resolved": "", "product": "Mac OS X", "description": "14-Nov-2010 12:14 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nhttp://www.extrapepperoni.com/post/2010/11/Mac-OS-X-Time-Machine%3A-Multiple-FAIL\r\n\r\nMac OS X Time Machine: Multiple FAIL\r\nBy reppep on Saturday, November 13 2010, 23:33 - bug - Permalink\r\nMy MacBook Pro's hard drive died last week. I got a new 250gb drive from Alex and replaced the dead one. Good thing I use Time Machine and a Time Capsule, I thought...\r\n\r\nFAIL #1: The Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard installer has an option to incorporate a Time Machine backup, so I mounted my Time Capsule. Unfortunately, Apple apparently hardwired the shared Data volume into this client. Of course, I chose to put my backups on my personal pepper volume, not the common Data volume accessible to other users! The Snow Leopard Installer absolutely refused to let me mount pepper or restore from Time Machine. I checked, and the backup is a 750gb .sparsebundle package on a 1tb Time Capsule, so I couldn't just move it over to the volume the Installer was fixated on -- not enough space.\r\n\r\nFAIL #2: I copied the whole .sparsebundle backup to an external 1tb disk, but the Installer couldn't see the backup. It saw the disk, but couldn't find the backup. I tried putting it into a Backup folder, but no joy. Fortunately the Installer points out that you can also restore from Migration Assistant after installation (necessary if you're restoring to a Mac other than the one which made the backup).\r\n\r\nSo I cursed a little, did a regular install, and rebooted.\r\n\r\nFAIL #3: Apple's welcome app (loud music & whizzy graphics) can restore Time Machine backups, but again couldn't see my pepper volume or restore from my hard disk. So I had to walk through creating my account again.\r\n\r\nFAIL #4: After logging in, I launched /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant (I know most people don't even know it exists, much less where, although it's easy enough to find if you know what you're looking for), and told it I wanted to restore from a Time Machine backup. Again, it was unable to see either my network or local backups, but once I double-clicked the .sparsebackup file it mounted as \"Time Machine Backups\" and Migration Assistant saw it. Confusingly, Migration Assistant showed the new volume as 'prowler (\"prowler\")', which doesn't match its name on the Desktop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMigration Assistant immediately complained that I was logged in as user pepper, and my backup included a user pepper, and it cannot replace the active account. I won't call this a failure because it's a legitimately intractable problem, but I used \"sudo passwd root\", logged in as root, and reran the migration -- this is hardly reasonable to expect of users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's hope Apple fixes the Time Machine restore functionality in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, because this is awful.", "classification": "Serious Bug", "title": "Time Machine restore capabilities are inadequate", "originated": "14-Nov-2010 12:14 AM", "product_version": "10.6 (10a432)", "number": "8666385", "user": "reppepreppep@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 866401}, {"status": "Duplicate/8655524", "resolved": "", "product": "iApps", "description": "13-Nov-2010 09:26 PM Brent Selch:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOpening iPhoto '11 under more than one account on the same machine causes the second copy to hang on startup. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen iPhoto under one user.\r\nSwitch to a second user\r\nOpen iPhoto under second user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSecond copy starts fine\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSecond copy hangs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis issue does not occur under iPhoto 8.x\r\n\r\nNotes:", "classification": "Serious Bug", "title": "Cannot run iPhoto under multiple accounts", "originated": "11-13-2010", "product_version": "9.0.1", "number": "8666310", "user": "brent@selch.org", "reproducible": "Yes", "id": 869401}, {"status": "Duplicate/5654856", "resolved": "", "product": "Pro Apps (Aperture)", "description": "Summary:\r\n\r\nAperture 3.1 (with Digital Camera RAW 3.1.4 - Build 5460000.1) exports versions of images with missing metadata.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Import a NEF image into aperture which has the \"Lens\" EXIF metadata\r\n- Export a jpg version\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe exported jpg should retain the \"Lens\" EXIF metadata.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe exported jpg does not have \"Lens\" EXIF metadata (which can be easily verified with exiftool).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has occurred since I first started using Aperture 3.0.

The phone rings when it is called. Users need to be able to quickly mute their phones when they are in a location where an unexpected ring might disturb others.\r\n\r\nThe iPad, however, does not receive phone calls, and thus (for the most part) it does not ring unexpectedly. Users are also much less likely to take it with them to a location, such as a theater or restaurant, where this mute function would receive a lot of use.\r\n \r\nThe iPad does, though, see heavy use near couches, beds and laps: all places where the device is frequently held at odd angles, and the user themselves may be in an odd orientation as well. In these common situations, controlling the rotation of the device is of much greater importance.\r\n\r\nAn argument could be made (and I suspect, was) that feature parity across iOS devices should include the existence of a dedicated mute switch. However, the iPad is a much different beast than its smaller iPhone and iPod touch brethren. I would argue that a feature used much more often (rotation lock) should have the dedicated switch, and that the previous functionality of holding the volume down toggle to mute was nearly as fast, and certainly fast enough. In contrast, iOS 4.2 has sped up the muting functionality slightly, while making the rotation lock a double-click, swipe and tap affair that takes far longer and annoys at least half a dozen registered developer users that I know, when polled about the issue.

The workstation is also running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, when the user logs in and tries to run 4D.app which they're explicitly allowed to run (via the group's preferences), it says \"You don't have permission to use the application 'Blah'\".\r\n\r\nNow, /Applications/4D/4D.app is added to the group's list of always allowed applications, unsigned (so a minor difference in application version or file contents shouldn't disallow it). It even lives in a subdirectory of /Applications which is in the list of folders to allow applications (/Applications/4D).\r\n\r\nTheir Home Sync preferences are set (on the group) to sync ~, but not the following files (manually, at login, and at logout... no background sync here):\r\n\r\n    ~/.SymAVQSFile\r\n    ~/NAVMac800QSFile\r\n    ~/Library\r\n    ~/.FileSync\r\n    ~/.account\r\n\r\nTheir Preferences Sync preferences are set (also on the group) to sync ~/Library & ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data, but not the following files (also manually, at login, and at logout... no background sync):\r\n\r\n    ~/.SymAVQSFile\r\n    ~/.Trash\r\n    ~/.Trashes\r\n    ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Entourage Temp\r\n    ~/Library/Application Support/SyncServices\r\n    ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync\r\n    ~/Library/Caches\r\n    ~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache\r\n    ~/Library/Logs\r\n    ~/Library/Mail/AvailableFeeds\r\n    ~/Library/Mail/Envelope Index\r\n    ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/\r\n    ~/Library/Printers\r\n    ~/Library/PubSub/Database\r\n    ~/Library/PubSub/Downloads\r\n    ~/Library/PubSub/Feeds\r\n    ~/Library/Safari/Icons.db\r\n    ~/Library/Safari/HistoryIndex.sk\r\n    ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates\r\n    IMAP-*\r\n    Exchange-*\r\n    EWS-*\r\n    Mac-*\r\n    ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost\r\n    ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\r\n    ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sitebarlists.plist\r\n    ~/Library/Application Support/4D\r\n    ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.MCX.plist\r\n    ~/.FileSync\r\n    ~/.account\r\n    ~/Library/Managed Items\r\n\r\nThe following workaround temporarily allows 4D.app to be run, but upon reboot it is no longer allowed:\r\n\r\n    1. Log in as the user (you'll discover you cannot launch the application in question).\r\n    2. Fast User Switch to the local admin account on the workstation (we always have one on every machine).\r\n    3. From that local admin account, run `sudo mcxrefresh -n 'shortname'` (logging out and back in as the user in question will not work).\r\n    4. Fast User Switch back to the user (you'll still not be allowed to run the application).\r\n    5. Log the user out and back in (you'll now be able to run the application in question.)\r\n    6. Fast User Switch back to the local admin account, log it out, and log back in as the user in question.\r\n\r\nIf you do all that exactly as described it'll keep working through log out & log back in, but NOT through a reboot. If, after a reboot, you try something like logging in as the local admin account, running `sudo mcxrefresh -n 'shortname'`, logging out, then logging in as the user in question, it will NOT work. Also, if you SSH into the machine as the local admin account and run `mcxrefresh`, it also WILL NOT WORK... you MUST Fast User Switch to a local admin account and leave the admin account running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Restart or cold boot the Snow Leopard workstation (we've tried MacBooks and iMacs), bound to the Open Directory Master.\r\n2. Log into the mobile home of the user in question.\r\n3. The 4D.app is a Login Item, it'll fail to launch.\r\n4. Run through the aforementioned temporary workaround.\r\n5. The 4D.app will have launched successfully.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe 4D.app, since explicitly allowed (unsigned) and contained in a folder that is also explicitly allowed to allow applications, should be allowed to launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe 4D.app is NOT allowed unless you run through the very odd temporary workaround. If you reboot the workstation, you must run the temporary workaround again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWe don't have _any_ computer groups in our Open Directory, so it shouldn't be getting any conflicting settings from there. I ran `sudo mcxquery -format xml -user shortname -group groupname` before & after performing the aforementioned process to allow the application in question to be run and the results were identical (saved the result to files & `diff`'d...

When a sudden spike occurs, it becomes a guessing game to sort out if it was the result of press, being featured, or a result of being ranked in a particular category.  Even worse, when sales have a downward spike there is no way to see why.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's even hard to track our own promotional efforts.  While we can track the number of people we send to the store, once they are there we have no idea if they inevitably were a part of that day's sales.\r\n\r\nThis lack of data leaves us flying blind when making decisions on how to focus our promotional efforts.\r\n\r\nI do not see a need for any advanced tools (think Google Analytics), but rather a few simple reports that would make an enormous difference in developers abilities to understand their sales.\r\n\r\nDevelopers could significantly benefit from seeing the following data about their app's page in the app store:\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nReferrers :\r\n\r\n- Where did the customer come from?  \r\n\r\nWas it a link on Lifehacker?  In a featured section in the app store?  Through browsing a particular category?  A link on our own site?\r\n\r\nThis is the most important piece.  Being able to know how a customer found the app allows us to separate out and make sense of our sales.  On a day-to-day basis we can steer our focus to what is working.  For the future planning, if we see that major part of our sales come from one particular source we won't be left stunned if that source suddenly disappears.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTraffic to App Store Page :\r\n\r\n- How many people viewed the app in the app store?\r\n- How many actually downloaded/purchased it?\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to see how our app messaging and screen-shots are converting.  If for example, an app was being viewed 1000 times in the store, but only had 10 downloads a day, the developer would quickly know there was a problem and missing a significant amount of potential customers.  Currently we only know the number of downloads and have no sense how many we might be missing.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI believe these two simple reports would make a world of difference in helping app developers make better decisions about their app store business.\r\n\r\nAppreciate all that you guys do there.

The phone rings when it is called. Users need to be able to quickly mute their phones when they are in a location where an unexpected ring might disturb others.\r\n\r\nThe iPad, however, does not receive phone calls, and thus (for the most part) it does not ring unexpectedly. Users are also much less likely to take it with them to a location, such as a theater or restaurant, where this mute function would receive a lot of use.\r\n \r\nThe iPad does, though, see heavy use near couches, beds and laps: all places where the device is frequently held at odd angles, and the user themselves may be in an odd orientation as well. In these common situations, controlling the rotation of the device is of much greater importance.\r\n\r\nAn argument could be made (and I suspect, was) that feature parity across iOS devices should include the existence of a dedicated mute switch. However, the iPad is a much different beast than its smaller iPhone and iPod touch brethren. I would argue that a feature used much more often (rotation lock) should have the dedicated switch, and that the previous functionality of holding the volume down toggle to mute was nearly as fast, and certainly fast enough. In contrast, iOS 4.2 has sped up the muting functionality slightly, while making the rotation lock a double-click, swipe and tap affair that takes far longer and annoys at least half a dozen registered developer users that I know, when polled about the issue. (I have encouraged them to file bugs with you as well.)\r\n\r\nHaving a system preference for this setting to switch between the two functions would be acceptable, but removing the original functionality completely is not.", "classification": "UI/Usability", "title": "Hardware switch on iPad running iOS 4.2 incorrectly performs mute function", "originated": "2010/10/10", "product_version": "4.2 (8C5101c)", "number": "8539012", "user": "boszko@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 740401}, {"status": "Open", "resolved": "", "product": "iOS", "description": "Please provide an on-screen Dvorak keyboard layout.

But this is complex, especially since there's no Copy button anywhere in Mobile Safari except the standard handling while editing the URL field, so most users won't do this. \r\n\r\n* Mail the link to a special email address. This works, but is tedious for users, and requires both a special email address to be installed in the user's Contacts and a corresponding web service to receive the email and synchronize with the app on next launch.\r\n\r\n* Use a Javascript bookmarklet to launch the app with a local URL scheme or send it to a corresponding web service.\r\n\r\nInstapaper supports all three, but very few people use the first two. Customers prefer the workflow that the bookmarklet offers.\r\n\r\nMost Instapaper customers install the bookmarklet directly in Mobile Safari. The process of doing this is extremely complex and user-hostile, and a large percentage of them abandon the process and are extremely dissatisfied with Safari, my app, and me as a result. I get angry emails from customers every day about this.\r\n\r\nThe current procedure:\r\n\r\n1. Send the user to a placeholder web page, with the Javascript code in a textarea. The user must Select All of the text in it and Copy it.\r\n\r\n2. The user must Add Bookmark for that page, then tap Done.\r\n\r\n3. The user must then open their Bookmarks, locate the newly created placeholder bookmark, tap Edit, and tap the bookmark (but not in the \"delete\" or \"move\" accessory areas) to select it for editing.\r\n\r\n4. The user must tap the Address line (which is not labeled as such when it is populated), tap the X \"clear-contents\" accessory, tap again in the Address line to invoke the pasteboard menu, tap Paste.\r\n\r\n5. The user must tap Done to dismiss the editing sheet, then tap Done again to leave the Bookmarks editing mode, and then tap Done a third time to dismiss the Bookmarks sheet.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this is extremely error-prone and tedious, and even skilled users often miss a step.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solutions that make bookmarklets unnecessary\r\n\r\nThe best way to solve this problem is to eliminate the need for hacky bookmarklets entirely:\r\n\r\n* Add a proper registry of apps that can accept URLs from Safari, recognized by an Info.plist key, and add a \"Share\" or \"Send To\" panel to Safari that allows users to easily send the current page's URL to any capable apps.\r\n\r\nBut I recognize that such a system would require major changes and is unlikely. Other potential solutions would still be incredibly helpful:\r\n\r\n* Add a public iOS API method for apps to prompt users to add a bookmark to Mobile Safari, e.g. in UIApplication:  \r\n    - (void)addSafariBookmarkWithURL:(NSURL *)url title:(NSString *)title\r\n\r\n* Alternately, add a Safari-handled URL scheme that apps can invoke to prompt users to add a bookmark, e.g.:  \r\n    safari:///addBookmark?url=&title=\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the user would be prompted by the OS and given an opportunity to decline.\r\n\r\nThese require changes to the public iOS APIs, so I recognize that they're still less likely to be implemented than simpler fixes. So here are some alternatives that I assume are even simpler and therefore more likely to be implemented:\r\n\r\n### Proposed solutions, still using bookmarklets\r\n\r\nInstalling bookmarklets could be dramatically improved with any of these simple changes:\r\n\r\n* Implement a Javascript method or URL scheme to prompt the user to add a bookmark with an arbitrary URL, specified in the code, like the old IE window.external.AddFavorite(url, title) method. If a web page could call such a method to bookmark an arbitrary javascript: URL, this entire process can be avoided.\r\n\r\n* Alternately, allowing window.location.href to be set to a javascript: URL, and then having that be the logical URL added when someone taps Add Bookmark, could eliminate almost the entire complex procedure. (Today, doing this just executes the Javascript but doesn't change the current page's URL for bookmarking.)\r\n\r\n* A less-desirable (but still helpful) alternative would be to make the Address field editable in the Add Bookmark sheet for new, unsaved bookmarks. Currently, it's only editable on edits of existing bookmarks, necessitating many extra steps in this process.\r\n\r\nAgain, any of these would be a huge help.

It's an app that helps teacher's learn student names. They often have a collection of pictures (or can export a collection of pictures) where the photo's file name is the student name. A typical teacher may have 200-300 students each semester! Adding each of these names to each photo on the iPhone is tedious at best, especially when they already have the photo and name correlated. Other customers are students using it to memorize rocks, plants and even artwork for different classes, and frequently the file name is already a title for the photo. I'd like to be able to use this information without having to build my own Mac and Windows syncing app. If I could access the title of the photo I'd be all set.", "classification": "Enhancement", "title": "Assets Library Framework: Unable to Access Photo's Title", "originated": "07-Oct-2010 03:23 PM", "product_version": "4.0", "number": "8526195", "user": "davidmikaelweiss@gmail.com", "reproducible": "Always", "id": 714403}]}
